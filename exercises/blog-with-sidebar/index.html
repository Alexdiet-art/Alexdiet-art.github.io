                    After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, 
                    they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger 
                    at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his
                    intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds
                    him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals
                    what he said to their parents. Carla is shocked and 
                    angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts
                    due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to 
                    talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her 
                    objections and instead announces that he will be 
                    leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he
                    comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden 
                    in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren 
                    joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. 
                    Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to
                    join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated
                    argument before he runs off. Eren and Mikasa scare
                    off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend 
                    Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin
                    rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities
                    to protect himself and admits he is weak. The 
                    three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by
                    the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions
                    of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.
