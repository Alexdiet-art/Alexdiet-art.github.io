        <h1>THE SHREDDED PHYLLO</h1>
        <p>
            We're going to break this recipe down into sections based
            on each component in this recipe! Now if you don't know yet,
            the name of this chocolate bar is called Can't Get Knafeh of
            It with Knafeh being a play on the word enough. Knafeh is 
            a Palestinian dessert popular throughout all of the Arab
            world that is made with crispy buttery phyllo strands 
            and stuffed with a sweet cheese filling. It's usually 
            covered in a simple syrup and then topped with lots of 
            pistachios. This chocolate bar takes everything from 
            the traditional dessert minus the sweet cheese.
        <p>
            We're going to start with the shredded phyllo dough which 
            is also called kataifi in Arabic. You can find it at most
            Arab/Middle Eastern grocery stores and this is what the 
            <b>packaging looks like.</b> Apollo Athens Food is my favorite
            brand to use for kataifi.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now if you happen to not have any Arab markets next to you,
            here are some other options you can use. There is nothing 
            that compares to the real thing but there are some other
            ingredients that can add a crunch. You can use puffed rice
            or puffed quinoa!
        </p>
        <p>
            To prepare the kataifi, start by cutting it up into 1/4 to 1/2
            inch long pieces. Kataifi usually comes in a package where it
            is all lumped up in an oval so you have to cut it. Once it's
            cut, it's time to heat up some vegetable oil in a frying pan.
            I prefer frying it for this recipe so it's all evenly toasted
            and it gives you the best crispy texture. Once the oil is 
            hot, 350°F, add the shredded phyllo in and fry until 
            beautifully golden. Make sure to stir it around as it 
            cooks so it evenly fries. If you are only frying one pan
            it'll be easier to set up a bowl with a strainer above 
            and just strain out the shredded phyllo from the oil.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transfer the fried phyllo to a plate with a paper towel to
            drain excess oil. Set aside to let it cool down a bit.
        </p>
        <h1>THE PISTACHIO BUTTER</h1>
        <p>
            Moving on to the second component - PISTACHIO BUTTER! I posted
            a teaser for this recipe on the internet and I was shocked 
            to see so many people did not know what pistachio paste/butter
            is. Everyone thought it was guacamole or other sorts of 
            inedible things. Arabs use pistachios and pistachio butter 
            in a lot of our desserts so it's totally normal to see a 
            green color. But anyway, my favorite brand of Pistachio Butter
            to use is Gusto, and <b>here is the link here to buy it.</b>
            It has the creamiest consistency and a beautiful 
            vibrant green color.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it is a little too solid when you open the jar, you can pop
            it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Add the pistachio butter to 
            a bowl along with the fried shredded phyllo. Mix together well 
            and now the filling is ready to go!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Another option instead of buying pistachio 
            butter is to make it yourself from scratch. You just need 
            to blend pistachios in a strong food processor/blender for 
            a really long time until it resembles nut butter. You can 
            then mix it with melted white chocolate or sweetened condensed
            milk to make it more smooth or creamy.
        </p>
        <h1>THE MOLDS</h1>
        <p>
            The hardest part is done, the filling! We have one more thing
            to discuss before we move into actually making the chocolate
            bars. I want to make sure to cover any questions you might have.
        </p>
        <p>
            What makes the Dubai Chocolate Bars unique is that they are 
            really thick since they are stuffed with pistachio filling. It
            can be hard to find molds that are thick enough but it took me
            a bit of searching before I stumbled on the perfect one. Here
            is the <b>link</b> to the one I got but it is currently out of 
            stock. There are so many other mold options available and although
            they might not be as thick, they will still be just as delicious.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b> If you don't want to order a mold, you can use a loaf
            pan used to make cake to create the chocolate bar. Get creative!
        </p>
        <h1>ASSEMBLING THE BARS</h1>
        <p>
            Ok let's get really into it now! Start by melting down
            some milk chocolate. You can also use semi-sweet or
            dark if that's your preference. Here is the
            <b>link to the milk chocolate</b> I use. It melts so
            beautifully every single time and I highly recommend it.
            Just add the chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl and heat
            in 30-second intervals, stirring each time until 
            completely melted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pour about 1/4 cup of melted chocolate into each mold and 
            shake it around until the bottom and sides are fully coated
            in chocolate. You may need more or less chocolate depending
            on the mold size you use. Transfer the molds to the
            refrigerator or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until it is solid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now add a generous amount of the crispy pistachio filling in
            the center until almost full to the top but not all the way.
            Pour more melted chocolate to cover the top entirely and 
            transfer back to the fridge/freezer until set.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then flip over the mold and the chocolate bar 
            should pop right out!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b> If you want to create a design on the bar, you
            can add edible gold dust to the bottom of the mold
            before adding anything in. Another option is to 
            drizzle melted white chocolate or white chocolate 
            with colored dye added. Then you can pour that first
            layer of milk chocolate in after and continue on with
            the rest of the steps.

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 cup pistachio paste/butter
            </li>
            <li>
                1 to 1/2 cup shredded phyllo or kataifi, 
                cut into small pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                vegetable oil, for frying
            </li>
            <li>
                2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 cup white chocolate, melted
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan to 350°F.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the shredded phyllo in and fry until golden and crispy.
                If frying another batch, use a slotted spoon to take out 
                the fried phyllo. Transfer to a plate with a paper towel
                to drain excess oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are not frying another batch, it'll be easier to 
                set up a bowl with a strainer and pour the pan over to let
                the oil drain and the strainer catch the phyllo.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow the fried phyllo to cool down for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the pistachio paste to a mixing bowl along with the 
                fried phyllo and mix together to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                OPTIONAL: To the chocolate mold, add a light drizzle of 
                white chocolate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then add in about 1/4 cup or more of melted milk chocolate
                and shake it around to cover the bottom and sides completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pop in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until hard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take the mold out and fill the chocolate mold with the 
                pistachio and phyllo mixture almost all the way to the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the filling entirely with more melted chocolate and pop 
                it back in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until
                hard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once set, pop out of the mold and enjoy!
            </li>
