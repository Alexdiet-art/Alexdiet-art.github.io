                        <b>Final Fantasy XIV</b><sup>[c]</sup> is a 
                        massively multiplayer online role-playing game
                        (MMORPG) developed and published by Square Enix.
                        Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida and 
                        released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows
                        in August 2013, it replaced the failed 2010 
                        version, with subsequent support for PlayStation 4,
                        macOS, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. 
                        <i>Final Fantasy XIV </i>is set in the fantasy    
                        region of Eorzea, five years
                        after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity 
                        which ended the original version. In the Calamity 
                        the elder primal Bahamut escaped 
                        from his prison, an ancient space station
                        called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse
                        across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, 
                        the player character of the original
                        version escaped, reappearing at the 
                        start of<i> A Realm Reborn</i>. As 
                        Eorzea cements its recovery, the player
                        must fend off a reignited invasion from 
                        the Garlean Empire.

                    <p>
                        <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> is an MMORPG, featuring
                        a persistent world where players can interact
                        with each other and the environment. Players 
                        create and customize their characters for use
                        in the game, including name, race, gender, 
                        facial features, and starting class. Unlike
                        in the original release, players may only 
                        choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic 
                        as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand
                        and Land are initially unavailable.<sup>[2]</sup>
                        Players must also select a game server for each 
                        character. While all supported languages are 
                        available on every server, data centers are 
                        located in specific regions (i.e., North America, 
                        Europe, Japan, and Oceania) to reduce latency 
                        between client and server, and players are 
                        advised to choose a server in their region.
                        <sup>[3]</sup> Regardless of server or language, 
                        players can use a large library of automatically
                        translated game terms and general phrases, 
                        allowing players who speak different languages
                        to communicate.<sup>[4]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="link-2">Interface</h3>
                    <p>
                        PC and home console versions use a unified user 
                        interface (UI) and control scheme allowing for 
                        any combination of keyboard, mouse, and game 
                        controller. On PC, the game defaults to drag 
                        and drop menus, whereas on the console versions, 
                        the default interface resembles the PlayStation 
                        3's XrossMediaBar.<sup>[5]</sup> This bar is used to 
                        access menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. 
                        The head-up display for both versions includes
                        a message log, party status menu, mini-map, 
                        and action bar. The size and location of all
                        UI elements may be customized.<sup>[6]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actions and battle commands differ between PC and
                        console versions. The PC versions support both 
                        point and click and keyboard input for commands
                        or macros. Macro commands are customizable 
                        sequences of actions that allow players to 
                        execute desired abilities at a specific time.
                        The home console versions instead map the
                        action bar and macros to the "Cross Hotbar"—sets
                        of four icons arranged in a cross shape. These
                        are the grouped and accessed through a combination
                        of the shoulder buttons and the directional pad 
                        or the face buttons. Using each shoulder button
                        to cycle through the cross sets, players have
                        quick access to commands. This interface is 
                        also available to PC players who use 
                        controllers.<sup>[5]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="link-3">Character progression</h3>
                    <p>
                        Players improve their characters by gaining experience
                        points (EXP) and acquiring stronger equipment. After
                        gaining enough XP, the character will "level up", 
                        improving their statistics, enhancing the character's 
                        performance, and often learning new actions. Primary
                        sources of experience points in 
                        <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> include completing quests, 
                        exploring instanced dungeons, participating in Full
                        Active Time Events (FATEs), and slaying monsters
                        in the world.<sup>[7]</sup> Quests, including the 
                        "main scenario" questline, are generally short, 
                        specific tasks given to the player by non-player 
                        characters which reward items and EXP. Completing
                        main scenario quests progresses the overarching 
                        plot of the game. Some quests are repeatable, 
                        either "daily" quests repeatable each day, or 
                        "Levequests", which consume "leve allowances" 
                        that the player slowly accrues over time. 
                        Dungeons often require multiple players to form a 
                        party to enter, but the Duty Support system enables
                        the player to play certain dungeons alone, supported
                        by computer-controlled party members. Some dungeons
                        are for lower-leveled players to gain EXP quickly
                        while others are for experienced players to collect
                        rare items, equipment, and currency.<sup>[8]</sup>
                        The Duty Roulette system randomly assigns 
                        the player to an accessible dungeon, and once per day, 
                        awards additional bonus EXP scaled to character level
                        on completion.<sup>[9]</sup> FATEs permit large groups 
                        of players, whether or not they are in a party, to
                        participate in a shared task in the world. These 
                        location-specific events include battles with 
                        notorious monsters, defending locations, escorting 
                        non-player characters, culling wildlife, and 
                        assaulting enemy fortresses, among other types.
                        <sup>[8]</sup> Finally, each enemy the player kills
                         provides EXP, with further EXP available from the
                        Hunting Log, for killing a fixed amount of specific
                        creatures. At maximum level, character progression
                        focuses entirely on acquiring stronger equipment, 
                        raising the character's "item level". This equipment
                        can be gained through a variety of sources including 
                        endgame dungeons, crafting, raids, primal battles,
                        and elite mark hunts.<sup>[10]</sup>

                    <p>
                        <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> is set on Hydaelyn, 
                        a fictional world of diverse environments across 
                        multiple continents, focused on the region of Eorzea.
                        <sup>[22]</sup> Eorzea features four prominent 
                        city-states: Gridania, in the heavily-forested Black 
                        Shroud; Ul'dah, a trade-centric sultanate in arid 
                        Thanalan; Limsa Lominsa, a thalassocracy on the island
                        of Vylbrand; and Ishgard, an isolationist theocracy
                        in snowy, mountainous Coerthas. A land bridge links
                        Eorzea to two other continents to the east, which
                        have largely been conquered by the Garlean Empire.
                        Other societies include indigenous tribes, such 
                        as Sylphs and Kobolds; Sharlayan, a scholarly 
                        city; and Ala Mhigo in eastern Eorzea, annexed 
                        twenty years prior by the Garlean Empire.<sup>[23]</sup>
                        Facing Garlean invasion, Ishgard withdrew from the 
                        Eorzean Alliance, leaving it defunct. The once-vibrant
                        Mor Dhona region was devastated during the previous 
                        Garlean campaign.<sup>[24]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eorzean history is divided into prosperous "Astral"
                        eras, and disastrous "Umbral" eras caused by great 
                        Calamities.<sup>[25]</sup> The First Umbral Era 
                        marked the end of the age of gods.<sup>[26]</sup> 
                        The Twelve, guardian deities of Eorzea, retreated 
                        from direct mortal contact. As society recovers from 
                        Umbral eras, new Astral eras begin. Under the hegemonic
                        Allagan Empire of the Third Astral era, technological 
                        development reached its zenith, including aerospace 
                        construction. As each Calamity was linked to one of 
                        the six fundamental elements—air, lightning, fire, 
                        earth, ice, and water—the Sixth Astral Era was 
                        expected to last forever, but five years ago, the 
                        Garlean Empire triggered the Seventh Umbral Calamity.
                        <sup>[26]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Garlean scientists working on Project Meteor 
                        weaponized the lesser moon Dalamud. Under Legatus
                        Nael van Darnus, they would annihilate Eorzea by 
                        crashing the moon, exterminating all opposition.
                        <sup>[27]</sup> The Alliance reunited in response,
                        reviving their Grand Company militaries. Adventurers 
                        defeated van Darnus but could not stop Dalamud's 
                        descent. At the Battle of Carteneau Flats in Mor
                        Dhona, Dalamud revealed itself as an ancient Allagan 
                        prison for the primal dragon Bahamut; his escape 
                        triggered the Seventh Umbral Calamity.<sup>[28]</sup>
                        Louisoix Leveilleur called upon the Twelve to imprison
                        Bahamut, but failed; before he sacrificed himself to
                        defeat Bahamut, he sent the adventurers "beyond the
                        reach of time" for when they were needed again.
                        <sup>[29]</sup> Meanwhile, the Empire became
                        paralyzed by a succession crisis as the elderly 
                        Emperor Solus fell ill.<sup>[30]</sup>
